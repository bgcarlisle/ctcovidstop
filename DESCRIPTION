Description: Provides a database of all ClinicalTrials.gov NCT Numbers
    corresponding to clinical trials that were "stopped" (had their
    overall status changed to "Terminated," "Suspended," or
    "Withdrawn") after 2019-12-01. This dataset indicates the date
    that a trial was stopped, whether it was started again and on what
    date, and the contents of the "why stopped?" field on the date the
    trial was stopped. This dataset also includes columns with
    manually coded data for whether the "why stopped?" field
    explicitly indicates that the reason for stopping included the
    SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
